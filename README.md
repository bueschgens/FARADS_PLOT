# FARADS_PLOT

## FARADS - Fast and Accurate calculation of RADiation heat transfer between arbitrary three-dimensional Surfaces

FARADS provides a framework for calculating view factors of arbitrary three-dimensional geometries. With these view factors the additional application of the net radiation method for calculating exchanged heat fluxes can be used.

other modules of FARADS:
- FARADS_GEOM
- FARADS_MESHING
- FARADS_VFCALC
- FARADS_QRAD

This module provides functions for plotting meshs, buckets, etc.
This module is based on GLMakie https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl [1]
